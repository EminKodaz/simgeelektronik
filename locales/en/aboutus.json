The establishment of Ankara's largest Alarm Monitoring Center and the acquisition of the distributorship of prestigious brands in Turkey particularly strengthened our leadership in the industry. Our mission is to achieve lasting excellence in the industry, provide the best service to customers, and be a pioneer. Customer satisfaction and quality are at the core of our business processes. Providing the highest value to our valued customers, offering quality products, and providing post-sales support are among our fundamental principles. For us, the greatest asset is our qualified human resources. The quality of our products and services begins with the abilities and dedication of our employees. Attracting the most talented personnel, enabling their development, and promoting a culture of collaboration are our priorities. Our goal is to leave a legacy that lasts for generations as Simge Group and contribute to a safer Turkey in the future.
